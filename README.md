Metro Data Analysis


A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to analyze metro passenger survey data, focusing on user feedback, travel patterns, and demand for service improvements, based on 1,227 survey responses.

(1)Short Description

A multi-page dashboard for exploring and understanding how metro passengers experience the service, revealing demographic trends, satisfaction levels, and areas of opportunity for future planning. Designed to showcase business intelligence skills through advanced data modeling, DAX measures, and actionable insights for metro operations teams.



(2)Key Technologies used


a)Power BI Desktop: For dashboard development, report building, and interactive data visualization.

b)Power Query: For data importing, cleaning, transformation, and ETL workflows within Power BI.

c)DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For advanced calculations, custom KPIs, measures, and dynamic analytics.

d)Excel: The source of the original survey dataset.

e)Star Schema Data Modeling: Building a normalized model with fact and dimension tables for efficient analytics.

f)Power BI Visual Elements: Cards, bar/column charts, donut/pie charts, 100% stacked charts, and slicers.

g)Custom Color Themes: For a consistent dashboard appearance and improved user experience.



(3)Dashboard Explanation


a)Business problem: Analyse metro data to understand passenger satisfaction, track feedback trends, and identify areas for service improvement based on user data.

b)Goal of the dashboard: Provide a unified and interactive BI dashboard that reveals satisfaction levels, demographic patterns, and service demands, utilizing survey responses to enable data-driven decisions.

c)Key visuals 


   i)Card visual: Used for total responses, average satisfaction, etc, for a quick reference

   ii)Bar and Column Charts: Used throughout for comparing counts across categories (e.g., Occupation Breakdown, Top Resident    Areas, Primary Transport Mode). Make it easy to see which groups are largest or most active.

   iii)Pie and Donut Charts: Used for showing proportions or shares within a whole, such as the percentage breakdown of          categories.

   iv)100% Stacked Bar Charts: To show distribution within groups (e.g., Satisfaction by Gender, Gender by Occupation).          Allowing the user to compare both totals and proportions side by side.

   v)Interactive Slicers & Filters: Enables users to narrow all visuals according to dimension (Gender, Occupation,              Education, Travel Purpose)


(d)Business Impact & Insights: The dashboard revealed that while 93.4% of users find the metro convenient, only 74.6% would recommend it, highlighting an 18.8% improvement gap. Pinpointed high-demand areas for feeder and extended services, and showed demographics with the strongest and weakest satisfaction scores, supporting strategic planning by metro operations.
